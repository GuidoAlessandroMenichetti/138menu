L4 Changes:
	
	- Added explorer.
	- Progress screen added. You will see it when installing/copying/moving files.
	- OSK changed a bit.
	- Improved stability.

L3 Changes:

	- Added a "Theme" feature in the settings category, place all your .138 theme files in the menu folder. 
	NOTE: DATA.138 must be in the folder, even if you are not using it; otherwise the menu will NOT start.
	
	- Added a "Background" feature to swap between the different PNG files in the folder (files starting with 
	"ICON" are excluded)

	- TN version included, which doesn't run backups at the moment in TN-V (TN-C and lower versions should run fine).	

	- Installing screen improved, now it lists the file with its size and progress percentage.	

	- Now font files come included in the Theme packages, if a theme doesn't have a font file then the default 
	font inside DATA.138 will be loaded. No need for LTN9.PGF file anymore :)
	
	- More protection added, so you don't delete the menu folder if you try to delete an Installer placed there,
	Only the file INSTALL.ZIP in that folder will be deleted if that was the case.
	- Now you need to confirm the message when you want to restore the default settings.
	- CEF version will now list the apps in the following order: ISOs > PSN > PSX > HOMEBREW
	- CEF version will now list all the ISOs placed in the menu folder.
